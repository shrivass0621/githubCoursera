My initial buisness problem will be which areas are more prone to car accidents. They way we will approach this problem is by getting various sources from popular cities such as San Jose and San Francisco and analyze the percentages of deaths and injuries in each of those cities and compare them to each other. Having this knowledge is important to understand how we can prevent more car accidents from happening and where you should be more careful.
